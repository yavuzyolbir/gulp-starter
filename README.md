# :wave: Hello everyone!

I wanted to share our gulp starter project for using html projects. 

### Whatâ€™s inside?
* [Gulp File Include] - a gulp plugin for file includes. 
* [Vanilla LazyLoad] - a lightweight and flexible script that speeds up your web application by deferring the loading of your below-the-fold images
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps  ( Just some scss files included. You can add other scss files if you need  )
* [ZeptoJs] - Zepto is a minimalist JavaScript library for modern browsers with a largely jQuery-compatible API.
* [Gulp Sass] - Sass plugin for Gulp.


### Installation

Just download zip file and

```sh
$ npm install
$ gulp
```

Have fun.
